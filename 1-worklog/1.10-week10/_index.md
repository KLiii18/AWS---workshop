### Week 10 Achievements:

* Strengthened **database fundamentals** through a structured review of relational vs. non-relational models, normalization, indexing, transactions, isolation levels, and high availability concepts essential to cloud database design.

* Gained deep knowledge of **Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora**, including:
  * Engine families  
  * Storage models  
  * Multi-AZ deployment  
  * Read Replicas  
  * Automated backups  
  * Failover operations  
  * Aurora’s distributed storage built for performance and durability  

* Expanded analytical and caching capabilities by learning:

  * **Amazon ElastiCache** (Redis/Memcached) for in-memory caching and low-latency workloads  

* Completed foundational database infrastructure labs:
  * Built a VPC designed specifically for database environments  
  * Configured EC2 & RDS Security Groups with least-privilege rules  
  * Created a **DB Subnet Group** spanning multiple Availability Zones  

* Successfully deployed an EC2 instance and created an RDS database instance, forming a complete **application-to-database architecture** inside a secure network.

* Performed an end-to-end application deployment connecting EC2 → RDS.  
  Practiced essential database operations including **backup and restore**, verifying durability and recoverability.

* Executed responsible cloud hygiene through full resource cleanup.

* Improved database migration expertise with an advanced, multi-stage lab involving:
  * EC2 Connect for database administration  
  * Oracle & MSSQL configuration  
  * Schema conversion using **AWS SCT**  
  * Migration tasks using **AWS DMS**  
  * Event monitoring, log analysis, performance tuning, troubleshooting  

* Gained practical, real-world experience in full **database migration pipelines**, including schema transformation, data replication, validation, and operational cleanup — reflecting authentic enterprise scenarios.
