### Week 11 Achievements:

* Strengthened **data engineering fundamentals** by creating an S3 bucket and building a **Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream**, gaining practical experience in real-time ingestion and durable storage pipelines.

* Developed practical skills in **sample data generation**, ingestion workflows, and downstream analytics.  
  Built a **Glue Crawler** to classify data and populate the Glue Data Catalog, then validated schema accuracy through structured data checks.

* Enhanced understanding of ETL workflows by explaining lab code logic, configuring S3 output storage, and establishing proper session connectivity for analytics tasks.

* Performed **end-to-end analytics** using Amazon Athena:
  * Querying data directly from S3  
  * Optimizing query performance  
  * Validating insights from processed datasets  

  Built visual dashboards using Amazon QuickSight to strengthen BI and visualization capabilities.

* Practiced **responsible cloud operations** by executing full resource cleanup.

* Gained both foundational and advanced **Amazon DynamoDB** knowledge, including:
  * Table creation  
  * Data exploration & CRUD operations  
  * NoSQL design considerations and workloads  

* Completed DynamoDB **backup and restore** operations and learned advanced design patterns:
  * Single-table design  
  * Partition key optimization  
  * Scalability, cost efficiency, and performance tuning  

* Built and deployed **global serverless architectures** using DynamoDB Global Tables, achieving multi-region replication and high availability.

* Extended serverless knowledge by integrating **DynamoDB Streams** with other AWS components, building reactive and scalable **event-driven architectures**.
