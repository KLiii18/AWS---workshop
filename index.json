	"content": "How INRIX accelerates transportation planning with Amazon Bedrock The complexity of modern traffic management extends far beyond mere road monitoring, encompassing massive amounts of data collected worldwide from connected cars, mobile devices, roadway sensors, and major event monitoring systems. For transportation authorities managing urban, suburban, and rural traffic flow, the challenge lies in effectively processing and acting upon this vast network of information. The task requires balancing immediate operational needs, such as real-time traffic redirection during incidents, with strategic long-term planning for improved mobility and safety.\nTraditionally, analyzing these complex data patterns and producing actionable insights has been a resource-intensive process requiring extensive collaboration. With recent advances in generative AI, there is an opportunity to transform how we process, understand, and act upon transportation data, enabling more efficient and responsive traffic management systems.\nIn this post, we partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer INRIX to demonstrate how Amazon Bedrock can be used to determine the best countermeasures for specific city locations using rich transportation data and how such countermeasures can be automatically visualized in street view images. This approach allows for significant planning acceleration compared to traditional approaches using conceptual drawings.\nINRIX pioneered the use of GPS data from connected vehicles for transportation intelligence. For over 20 years, INRIX has been a leader for probe-based connected vehicle and device data and insights, powering automotive, enterprise, and public sector use cases. INRIX’s products range from tickerized datasets that inform investment decisions for the financial services sector to digital twins for the public rights-of-way in the cities of Philadelphia and San Francisco. INRIX was the first company to develop a crowd-sourced traffic network, and they continue to lead in real-time mobility operations.\nIn June 2024, the State of California’s Department of Transportation (Caltrans) selected INRIX for a proof of concept for a generative AI-powered solution to improve safety for vulnerable road users (VRUs). The problem statement sought to harness the combination of Caltrans’ asset, crash, and points-of-interest (POI) data and INRIX’s 50 petabyte (PB) data lake to anticipate high-risk locations and quickly generate empirically validated safety measures to mitigate the potential for crashes. Trained on real-time and historical data and industry research and manuals, the solution provides a new systemic, safety-based methodology for risk assessment, location prioritization, and project implementation.\nSolution overview INRIX announced INRIX Compass in November 2023. INRIX Compass is an application that harnesses generative AI and INRIX’s 50 PB data lake to solve transportation challenges. This solution uses INRIX Compass countermeasures as the input, AWS serverless architecture, and Amazon Nova Canvas as the image visualizer. Key components include:\nCountermeasures generation: INRIX Compass generates the countermeasures for a selected location Amazon API Gateway and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) manage API requests and responses Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Anthropic’s Claude Models provide Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation Image visualization API Gateway and AWS Lambda process requests from API Gateway and Amazon Bedrock Amazon Bedrock with model access to Amazon Nova Canvas provide image generation and in-painting The following diagram shows the architecture of INRIX Compass.\nINRIX Compass for countermeasures By using INRIX Compass, users can ask natural language queries such as, Where are the top five locations with the highest risk for vulnerable road users? and Can you recommend a suite of proven safety countermeasures at each of these locations? Furthermore, users can probe deeper into the roadway characteristics that contribute to risk factors, and find similar locations in the roadway network that meet those conditions. Behind the scenes, Compass AI uses RAG and Amazon Bedrock powered foundation models (FMs) to query the roadway network to identify and prioritize locations with systemic risk factors and anomalous safety patterns. The solution provides prioritized recommendations for operational and design solutions and countermeasures based on industry knowledge.\nThe following image shows the interface of INRIX Compass.\nImage visualization for countermeasures The generation of countermeasure suggestions represents the initial phase in transportation planning. Image visualization requires the crucial next step of preparing conceptual drawings. This process has traditionally been time-consuming due to the involvement of multiple specialized teams, including:\nTransportation engineers who assess technical feasibility and safety standards Urban planners who verify alignment with city development goals Landscape architects who integrate environmental and aesthetic elements CAD or visualization specialists who create detailed technical drawings Safety analysts who evaluate the potential impact on road safety Public works departments who oversee implementation feasibility Traffic operations teams who assess impact on traffic flow and management These teams work collaboratively, creating and iteratively refining various visualizations based on feedback from urban designers and other stakeholders. Each iteration cycle typically involves multiple rounds of reviews, adjustments, and approvals, often extending the timeline significantly. The complexity is further amplified by city-specific rules and design requirements, which often necessitate significant customization. Additionally, local regulations, environmental considerations, and community feedback must be incorporated into the design process. Consequently, this lengthy and costly process frequently leads to delays in implementing safety countermeasures. To streamline this challenge, INRIX has pioneered an innovative approach to the visualization phase by using generative AI technology. This prototyped solution enables rapid iteration of conceptual drawings that can be efficiently reviewed by various teams, potentially reducing the design cycle from weeks to days. Moreover, the system incorporates a few-shot learning approach with reference images and carefully crafted prompts, allowing for seamless integration of city-specific requirements into the generated outputs. This approach not only accelerates the design process but also supports consistency across different projects while maintaining compliance with local standards.\nThe following image shows the congestion insights by INRIX Compass.\nAmazon Nova Canvas for conceptual visualizations INRIX developed and prototyped this solution using Amazon Nova models. Amazon Nova Canvas delivers advanced image processing through text-to-image generation and image-to-image transformation capabilities. The model provides sophisticated controls for adjusting color schemes and manipulating layouts to achieve desired visual outcomes. To promote responsible AI implementation, Amazon Nova Canvas incorporates built-in safety measures, including watermarking and content moderation systems.\nThe model supports a comprehensive range of image editing operations. These operations encompass basic image generation, object removal from existing images, object replacement within scenes, creation of image variations, and modification of image backgrounds. This versatility makes Amazon Nova Canvas suitable for a wide range of professional applications requiring sophisticated image editing.\nThe following sample images show an example of countermeasures visualization.\nIn-painting implementation in Compass AI Amazon Nova Canvas integrates with INRIX Compass’s existing natural language analytics capabilities. The original Compass system generated text-based countermeasure recommendations based on:\nHistorical transportation data analysis Current environmental conditions User-specified requirements The INRIX Compass visualization feature specifically uses the image generation and in-painting capabilities of Amazon Nova Canvas. In-painting enables object replacement through two distinct approaches:\nA binary mask precisely defines the areas targeted for replacement. Text prompts identify objects for replacement, allowing the model to interpret and modify the specified elements while maintaining visual coherence with the surrounding image context. This functionality provides seamless integration of new elements while preserving the overall image composition and contextual relevance. The developed interface accommodates both image generation and in-painting approaches, providing comprehensive image editing capabilities. The implementation follows a two-stage process for visualizing transportation countermeasures. Initially, the system employs image generation functionality to create street-view representations corresponding to specific longitude and latitude coordinates where interventions are proposed. Following the initial image creation, the in-painting capability enables precise placement of countermeasures within the generated street view scene. This sequential approach provides accurate visualization of proposed modifications within the actual geographical context.\nAn Amazon Bedrock API facilitates image editing and generation through the Amazon Nova Canvas model. The responses contain the generated or modified images in base64 format, which can be decoded and processed for further use in the application. The generative AI capabilities of Amazon Bedrock enable rapid iteration and simultaneous visualization of multiple countermeasures within a single image. RAG implementation can further extend the pipeline’s capabilities by incorporating county-specific regulations, standardized design patterns, and contextual requirements. The integration of these technologies significantly streamlines the countermeasure deployment workflow. Traditional manual visualization processes that previously required extensive time and resources can now be executed efficiently through automated generation and modification. This automation delivers substantial improvements in both time-to-deployment and cost-effectiveness.\nConclusion The partnership between INRIX and AWS showcases the transformative potential of AI in solving complex transportation challenges. By using Amazon Bedrock FMs, INRIX has turned their massive 50 PB data lake into actionable insights through effective visualization solutions. This post highlighted a single specific transportation use case, but Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Nova power a wide spectrum of applications, from text generation to video creation. The combination of extensive data and advanced AI capabilities continues to pave the way for smarter, more efficient transportation systems worldwide.\nFor more information, check out the documentation for Amazon Nova Foundation Models, Amazon Bedrock, and INRIX Compass.\n"

Prerequisites To deploy Qwen3 models, make sure you have access to the recommended instance types based on the model size. You can find these instance recommendations on Amazon Bedrock Marketplace or the SageMaker JumpStart console. To verify you have the necessary resources, complete the following steps:\nOpen the Service Quotas console. Under AWS Services, select Amazon SageMaker. Check that you have sufficient quota for the required instance type for endpoint deployment. Make sure at least one of these instance types is available in your target AWS Region. If needed, request a quota increase and contact your AWS account team for support.\nDeploy Qwen3 in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace Amazon Bedrock Marketplace gives you access to over 100 popular, emerging, and specialized foundation models (FMs) through Amazon Bedrock. To access Qwen3 in Amazon Bedrock, complete the following steps:\nOn the Amazon Bedrock console, in the navigation pane under Foundation models, choose Model catalog. Filter for Hugging Face as a provider and choose a Qwen3 model. For this example, we use the Qwen3-32B model. The model detail page provides essential information about the model’s capabilities, pricing structure, and implementation guidelines. You can find detailed usage instructions, including sample API calls and code snippets for integration.\nThe page also includes deployment options and licensing information to help you get started with Qwen3-32B in your applications.\nTo begin using Qwen3-32B, choose Deploy. You will be prompted to configure the deployment details for Qwen3-32B. The model ID will be pre-populated. 2. For Endpoint name, enter an endpoint name (between 1–50 alphanumeric characters). 3. For Number of instances, enter a number of instances (between 1–100). 4. For Instance type, choose your instance type. For optimal performance with Qwen3-32B, a GPU-based instance type like ml.g5-12xlarge is recommended. 5. To deploy the model, choose Deploy.\nWhen the deployment is complete, you can test Qwen3-32B’s capabilities directly in the Amazon Bedrock playground.\nChoose Open in playground to access an interactive interface where you can experiment with different prompts and adjust model parameters like temperature and maximum length. This is an excellent way to explore the model’s reasoning and text generation abilities before integrating it into your applications. The playground provides immediate feedback, helping you understand how the model responds to various inputs and letting you fine-tune your prompts for optimal results.You can quickly test the model in the playground through the UI. However, to invoke the deployed model programmatically with any Amazon Bedrock APIs, you must have the endpoint Amazon Resource Name (ARN).\nEnable reasoning and non-reasoning responses with Converse API The following code shows how to turn reasoning on and off with Qwen3 models using the Converse API, depending on your use case. By default, reasoning is left on for Qwen3 models, but you can streamline interactions by using the /no_think command within your prompt. When you add this to the end of your query, reasoning is turned off and the models will provide just the direct answer. This is particularly useful when you need quick information without explanations, are familiar with the topic, or want to maintain a faster conversational flow. At the time of writing, the Converse API doesn’t support tool use for Qwen3 models. Refer to the Invoke_Model API example later in this post to learn how to use reasoning and tools in the same completion.\nimport boto3 from botocore.exceptions import ClientError # Create a Bedrock Runtime client in the AWS Region you want to use. client = boto3.client(\u0026#34;bedrock-runtime\u0026#34;, region_name=\u0026#34;us-west-2\u0026#34;) # Configuration model_id = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Replace with Bedrock Marketplace endpoint arn # Start a conversation with the user message. user_message = \u0026#34;hello, what is 1+1 /no_think\u0026#34; #remove /no_think to leave default reasoning on conversation = [ { \u0026#34;role\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: user_message}], } ] try: # Send the message to the model, using a basic inference configuration. response = client.converse( modelId=model_id, messages=conversation, inferenceConfig={\u0026#34;maxTokens\u0026#34;: 512, \u0026#34;temperature\u0026#34;: 0.5, \u0026#34;topP\u0026#34;: 0.9}, ) # Extract and print the response text. #response_text = response[\u0026#34;output\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;content\u0026#34;][0][\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;] #reasoning_content = response [\u0026#34;output\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;][\u0026#34;reasoning_content\u0026#34;][0][\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;] #print(response_text, reasoning_content) print(response) except (ClientError, Exception) as e: print(f\u0026#34;ERROR: Can\u0026#39;t invoke \u0026#39;{model_id}\u0026#39;.

With SageMaker JumpStart, you can customize pre-trained models to your use case, with your data, and deploy them into production using either the UI or SDK.Deploying the Qwen3-32B model through SageMaker JumpStart offers two convenient approaches: using the intuitive SageMaker JumpStart UI or implementing programmatically through the SageMaker Python SDK. Let’s explore both methods to help you choose the approach that best suits your needs.\nDeploy Qwen3-32B through SageMaker JumpStart UI Complete the following steps to deploy Qwen3-32B using SageMaker JumpStart:\nOn the SageMaker console, choose Studio in the navigation pane. First-time users will be prompted to create a domain. On the SageMaker Studio console, choose JumpStart in the navigation pane. The model browser displays available models, with details like the provider name and model capabilities.\nSearch for Qwen3 to view the Qwen3-32B model card. Each model card shows key information, including:\nModel name Provider name Task category (for example, Text Generation) Bedrock Ready badge (if applicable), indicating that this model can be registered with Amazon Bedrock, so you can use Amazon Bedrock APIs to invoke the model Choose the model card to view the model details page. The model details page includes the following information:\nThe model name and provider information A Deploy button to deploy the model About and Notebooks tabs with detailed information The About tab includes important details, such as:\nModel description License information Technical specifications Usage guidelines Before you deploy the model, it’s recommended to review the model details and license terms to confirm compatibility with your use case. 6. Choose Deploy to proceed with deployment. 7. For Endpoint name, use the automatically generated name or create a custom one. 8. For Instance type, choose an instance type (default: ml.g6-12xlarge). 9. For Initial instance count, enter the number of instances (default: 1).\nSelecting appropriate instance types and counts is crucial for cost and performance optimization. Monitor your deployment to adjust these settings as needed. Under Inference type, Real-time inference is selected by default. This is optimized for sustained traffic and low latency. 10. Review all configurations for accuracy. For this model, we strongly recommend adhering to SageMaker JumpStart default settings and making sure that network isolation remains in place. 11. Choose Deploy to deploy the model.\nThe deployment process can take several minutes to complete.\nWhen deployment is complete, your endpoint status will change to InService. At this point, the model is ready to accept inference requests through the endpoint. You can monitor the deployment progress on the SageMaker console Endpoints page, which will display relevant metrics and status information. When the deployment is complete, you can invoke the model using a SageMaker runtime client and integrate it with your applications.\nDeploy Qwen3-32B using the SageMaker Python SDK To get started with Qwen3-32B using the SageMaker Python SDK, you must install the SageMaker Python SDK and make sure you have the necessary AWS permissions and environment set up. The following is a step-by-step code example that demonstrates how to deploy and use Qwen3-32B for inference programmatically:\n!pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir sagemaker==2.235.2 from sagemaker.serve.builder.model_builder import ModelBuilder from sagemaker.serve.builder.schema_builder import SchemaBuilder from sagemaker.jumpstart.model import ModelAccessConfig from sagemaker.session import Session import logging sagemaker_session = Session() artifacts_bucket_name = sagemaker_session.default_bucket() execution_role_arn = sagemaker_session.get_caller_identity_arn() # Changed to Qwen32B model js_model_id = \u0026#34;huggingface-reasoning-qwen3-32b\u0026#34; gpu_instance_type = \u0026#34;ml.g5.12xlarge\u0026#34; response = \u0026#34;Hello, I\u0026#39;m a language model, and I\u0026#39;m here to help you with your English.\u0026#34; sample_input = { \u0026#34;inputs\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello, I\u0026#39;m a language model,\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;max_new_tokens\u0026#34;: 128, \u0026#34;top_p\u0026#34;: 0.9, \u0026#34;temperature\u0026#34;: 0.6 } } sample_output = [{\u0026#34;generated_text\u0026#34;: response}] schema_builder = SchemaBuilder(sample_input, sample_output) model_builder = ModelBuilder( model=js_model_id, schema_builder=schema_builder, sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session, role_arn=execution_role_arn, log_level=logging.ERROR ) model = model_builder.build() predictor = model.deploy( model_access_configs={js_model_id: ModelAccessConfig(accept_eula=True)}, accept_eula=True ) predictor.predict(sample_input) You can run additional requests against the predictor:\nnew_input = { \u0026#34;inputs\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;What is Amazon doing in Generative AI?\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;max_new_tokens\u0026#34;: 64, \u0026#34;top_p\u0026#34;: 0.8, \u0026#34;temperature\u0026#34;: 0.7}, } prediction = predictor.predict(new_input) print(prediction) The following are some error handling and best practices to enhance deployment code:\n# Enhanced deployment code with error handling import backoff import botocore import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) @backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, (botocore.exceptions.ClientError,), max_tries=3) def deploy_model_with_retries(model_builder, model_id): try: model = model_builder.build() predictor = model.deploy( model_access_configs={model_id:ModelAccessConfig(accept_eula=True)}, accept_eula=True ) return predictor except Exception as e: logger.error(f\u0026#34;Deployment failed: {str(e)}\u0026#34;) raise def safe_predict(predictor, input_data): try: return predictor.predict(input_data) except Exception as e: logger.error(f\u0026#34;Prediction failed: {str(e)}\u0026#34;) return None Clean up To avoid unwanted charges, complete the steps in this section to clean up your resources.\nDelete the Amazon Bedrock Marketplace deployment If you deployed the model using Amazon Bedrock Marketplace, complete the following steps:\nOn the Amazon Bedrock console, under Foundation models in the navigation pane, choose Marketplace deployments. In the Managed deployments section, locate the endpoint you want to delete. Select the endpoint, and on the Actions menu, choose Delete. Verify the endpoint details to make sure you’re deleting the correct deployment: Endpoint name Model name Endpoint status Choose Delete to delete the endpoint. In the deletion confirmation dialog, review the warning message, enter confirm, and choose Delete to permanently remove the endpoint. Delete the SageMaker JumpStart predictor The SageMaker JumpStart model you deployed will incur costs if you leave it running. Use the following code to delete the endpoint if you want to stop incurring charges. For more details, see Delete Endpoints and Resources.\npredictor.delete_model() predictor.delete_endpoint() Conclusion In this post, we explored how you can access and deploy the Qwen3 models using Amazon Bedrock Marketplace and SageMaker JumpStart. With support for both the full parameter models and its distilled versions, you can choose the optimal model size for your specific use case.

	"content": "AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering Event Objectives The event aimed to clarify the evolving role of AI in modern software development, specifically:\nIntroducing emerging trends in AI-Driven Development – an AI-supported and AI-orchestrated software development model. Presenting the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) framework, which integrates AI throughout the development process Demonstrating two representative tools: Amazon Q Developer and Kiro IDE Extension. Analyzing how AI enhances speed, productivity, and product quality for software development teams. Defining the future role of AI in development workflows. Speakers Lecturers: Toan Huynh \u0026amp; My Nguyen Facilitators: Diem My, Dai Truong, Dinh Nguyen Key Highlights Opening – The Future of Software Development with AI Mr. Toan Huynh presented the topic “Shaping the Future of Development,” describing the transition from traditional workflows to AI-Orchestrated Development, where AI coordinates various phases of product development — from planning and design to coding and operations.\nLimitations of Current Development Models Current approaches such as AI-Assisted Development and AI-Managed Development still face limitations in stability, reliability, and explainability. Thus, AI-Driven Development (AI-DD) is introduced as a balanced approach: AI provides deep support, but humans remain the central decision-makers.\nAI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) Framework AI-DLC consolidates three stages of AI maturity in the software development process:\nAI-Assisted Development: AI suggests code, helps fix bugs, checks syntax. AI-Driven Development: AI contributes to architecture design, planning, and technical proposals. AI-Managed Development: AI orchestrates the entire workflow, while humans provide final approval. In this model, AI acts as an “intelligent coordinator,” while developers validate and finalize results.\nBenefits of AI in Software Development The “AI in Development – Outcomes” section highlights seven core values:\nPredictability – improved stability and timeline forecasting. Velocity – faster time-to-market. Quality – fewer bugs and higher system reliability. Innovation – more creative solution paths. Developer Engagement – increased motivation and focus. Customer Satisfaction – better user experience and service quality. Productivity – optimized effort and time savings. SDLC Phases and AI’s Role According to the SDLC time distribution diagram, the process includes: Explore \u0026amp; Plan → Create → Test \u0026amp; Secure → Review \u0026amp; Deploy → Maintain, Transform \u0026amp; Modernize\nAI significantly reduces time spent in heavy phases such as testing, deployment, and maintenance through automation and smart analytics.\nStandard AI-DLC Workflow The standard AI-DLC model consists of four steps:\nRequirement – The Product Owner analyzes and collects requirements. Design – The system architect defines architecture, APIs, and workflows. Implementation – Software engineers code, test, and integrate. Deployment – System deployment and monitoring. AI accompanies all four steps to ensure clarity and alignment across roles.\nKey Features of the AI-DLC Workflow As described in “Key Workflow Features,” the process includes:\nRole Separation – clear division of responsibilities between business, architecture, and development. AI-Enhanced – AI generates role-specific contexts to provide optimal assistance. Iterative – continuous feedback loops across all phases. Template-Driven – standardized outputs using unified AIDLC templates. AI in Each Development Phase AI supports each step in three primary ways:\nSpecific Context – AI works with tailored personas (PM, Dev, Architect). Clear Inputs/Outputs – well-defined inputs and deliverables for each stage. Interactive Workflow – enhanced two-way interaction between AI and humans. Documentation – AI continuously updates all related documentation. Practical Demos: Amazon Q Developer \u0026amp; Kiro IDE Amazon Q Developer\nIntegrated directly into VS Code and Cloud9. Generates code, writes tests, creates documentation, proposes AWS architecture. Auto-updates prompt.md, suggests user stories, and supports CI/CD. The demo showcased AI-driven project planning and management via commands. Kiro IDE (presented by My Nguyen)\nA tool that generates specification documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md). AI helps define APIs, generate features, and produce backend code. The demo demonstrated AI automatically generating a chat application with user authentication. Key Takeaways AI is a collaborator, not a replacement for developers. AI-DLC makes the development lifecycle clearer, more standardized, and easier to control. Amazon Q Developer significantly improves speed and reduces errors in SDLC. Kiro IDE demonstrates AI’s capability to support everything from requirements to code generation. DevSecOps combined with AI will become an essential industry standard. Real-World Applications Using Amazon Q Developer to automate testing and documentation in internal projects. Applying Kiro IDE to standardize specifications and accelerate backend development. Running an experimental “AI-Driven Sprint” to measure the impact of AI within the team. Implementing AI-Assisted Code Review to improve product quality. Personal Reflection The workshop “AI-Driven Development Workshop” provided many practical insights.\nMr. Toan Huynh’s presentation helped me better understand the strategic role AI will play in the future of software development, while Ms. My Nguyen’s demo with Kiro IDE demonstrated how AI can fully support the process from requirement analysis to code generation.\nThe event changed my perspective on AI: it is not merely a supporting tool, but a foundation that enables organizations to innovate faster and more sustainably.\nSome event photos "

	"content": "Workshop \u0026ldquo;Data science on AWS” - Unlock the Power of Data with Cloud Computing Event Objectives Exploring the journey of building a modern Data Science system.\nSpeakers Van Hoang Kha – Cloud Solutions Architect, AWS Community Builder Bach Doan Vuong – Cloud DevOps Engineer, AWS Community Builder Key Highlights Overview of AI and Foundational Concepts (by Mr. Kha) Mr. Kha began the session by systematizing the essential concepts in the field of artificial intelligence:\nArtificial Intelligence (AI): Described as a “virtual assistant,” AI allows machines to simulate human-like learning and analytical abilities. AI can process large volumes of data at high speed and continuously improve by learning from new data. Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from numerical or text data to make predictions or classifications. Deep Learning (DL): A deep neural network approach that enables machines to understand complex data types such as images, audio, and unstructured data. Generative AI: A type of AI model trained on massive datasets to generate new content such as text, images, or videos. Examples include Google’s Gemini and AWS’s Amazon Bedrock. This represents a major advancement over ML and DL because the model can “create,” rather than just predict. AI/ML Service Layers on AWS (by Mr. Kha) Mr. Kha explained how AWS builds its AI ecosystem across three layers:\nLayer 1 – AI Services\nReady-to-use services where users call APIs to solve specific problems such as computer vision, natural language processing, or text-to-speech.\nLayer 2 – ML Services\nDesigned for users who need full control over data processing, model building, training, and fine-tuning. Amazon SageMaker is the central service, similar to Google Colab but more powerful and enterprise-ready.\nLayer 3 – ML Frameworks \u0026amp; Infrastructure\nAWS provides compute infrastructure with GPU/CPU hardware in collaboration with companies like NVIDIA to support training very large models.\nTypical AI Services on AWS Several powerful AI services were showcased:\nAmazon Comprehend: Natural language processing and text information extraction Amazon Translate: Deep learning–based translation Amazon Transcribe: Speech-to-text conversion Amazon Polly: Text-to-speech with natural-sounding voices Amazon Textract: Automated extraction from scanned documents and handwriting Amazon Rekognition: Face/object recognition and video analysis Amazon Personalize: Personalized recommendations like those used by Netflix or YouTube Machine Learning Model Building Workflow Mr. Kha shared the standard ML development lifecycle:\nFeature Engineering – Clean, transform, and prepare data Model Training – Teach the machine to learn patterns Evaluation \u0026amp; Tuning – Test accuracy and iterate if needed Deployment – Serve the model for real-world use Monitoring \u0026amp; Improvement – Collect feedback and update the model AWS also introduced SageMaker Canvas, a no-code tool for building and deploying ML models with a simple drag-and-drop interface.\nHands-on Demo (by Mr. Vương) Cleaning IMDb Data with AWS Glue\nRaw data stored in S3 AWS Glue automatically cleaned, processed, and normalized the data Processed data returned to S3, ready for training in SageMaker Cost comparison: Cloud vs. On-Premise\nCloud reduces upfront infrastructure and maintenance costs AWS allows scaling resources as needed, without hardware limits Experimenting with different models becomes faster and more flexible than with self-hosted systems Key Takeaways Strategy comes before technology: Digital transformation and GenAI adoption are most effective when driven by business needs—not trends. Migration requires a clear roadmap: Moving systems to the cloud should be done in phases to control risks and measure progress. GenAI accelerates software development: Through the Amazon Q Developer demo, I better understood how AI can automate many steps in the SDLC. Security must be built from the beginning: Security is not a “patching” stage—it must be embedded throughout the entire system design. People remain the decisive factor: No matter how advanced the technology is, success depends on mindset, learning ability, and execution. Practical Applications Conducting event storming sessions to identify AI use cases aligned with real business needs Integrating Amazon Q Developer into the current development workflow to measure improvements in coding, testing, and reviewing Planning phased cloud migration, starting with priority workloads to reduce risks Applying DevSecOps, ensuring end-to-end security from development to deployment Increasing internal discussions about AI/Cloud strategies for better team alignment Personal Reflections This event left a strong impression on me:\nThe GenAI discussion was highly practical, with varied viewpoints but a shared belief that AI must serve business goals. Watching the live demo of Amazon Q Developer gave me a clear vision of the future of AI-assisted software development. Networking with many experts and builders broadened my perspectives and provided valuable insights. Overall, the event was both inspirational and deeply practical, supporting my journey in Cloud and GenAI.\nSome event photos "

	"content": "Teaching Center Management System AWS Serverless Solution for Teaching Center Management Project 1. Executive Summary The project focuses on deploying an LMS (Learning Management System) platform serving core training operations, equivalent in scope to systems like lms-hcmuni.fpt.edu.vn. Specifically, the scope includes 2 main parts: academic management and authentication/identification and authorization.\nThe goal is to provide essential LMS capabilities: managing courses and classes; class schedules; searching and enrollment using enrollKey; role-based dashboards (Admin, Teacher, Student); managing instructor/student profiles; managing course documents on S3 (creating folders, uploading, downloading with enrollment verification); and batch data import from Excel to quickly initialize academic data. The authentication/identification and authorization part ensures login/authentication with Amazon Cognito (supporting OAuth/Google), invitation/redemption of invitations, password reset/change, token refresh, user profiles, and role-based authorization mechanisms to protect academic resources.\nIn the future, the system can gradually expand to other modules (CRM, payments, HRM, etc.) and consider integrating AI/IoT when needed, but these are not within the scope of the current deployment.\n2. Problem Statement Current Issues\nIn the LMS context, many training units operate in silos with discrete steps: creating courses/classes, publishing schedules, enrolling students, managing documents, and accessing profiles — typically across multiple different tools. This leads to fragmented data, difficult access control, manual enrollment processes (prone to errors), and inconsistent user experience between instructors and students.\nAs the number of courses/classes increases, there\u0026rsquo;s a lack of unified role-based authorization mechanisms, reliable authentication (SSO/OAuth), and clear academic APIs to support role-based dashboards. The absence of batch data import channels also causes delays when initializing new semesters.\nSolution\nThe platform is deployed on AWS Serverless architecture, focusing on addressing two main pillars:\nAuthentication/Identification and Authorization: Amazon Cognito for authentication (email/password, Google OAuth), invitations (invite/redeem), password reset/change, token refresh, user profiles; role-based authorization (ADMIN/TEACHER/STUDENT) to protect APIs and academic resources. Academic Management: APIs for managing courses/classes, unified search, enrollment using enrollKey (activating PRE_ENROLLED → ACTIVE), role-based dashboards, instructor/student profiles, and course document management on S3 (creating folders, presigned upload/download with enrollment verification). Supports Excel import for quick data initialization and full rollback on errors. The access flow: CloudFront → S3 (static content) and API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB (academic/identity data) with CloudWatch/SNS/Secrets Manager for monitoring and security. CI/CD is implemented through GitLab Runner combined with AWS SAM CLI.\nBenefits and Return on Investment (ROI)\nAccelerated development and deployment: Automated CI/CD with GitLab Runner and CloudFormation reduces feature release time from days to hours. Optimized operational costs: Serverless architecture (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway) charges only per request, saving 40–60% of costs compared to traditional EC2. Comprehensive security: Secrets Manager and Cognito combined with IAM provide robust protection for sensitive data and strict access control. High access performance: CloudFront CDN accelerates access and reduces latency by 50–70%. Flexible scalability: The system automatically scales according to traffic without manual intervention. Proactive monitoring: CloudWatch + SNS provides real-time alerts, helping the technical team respond promptly to incidents. 3. Solution Architecture Detailed Description User Request Flow\nUsers open a browser and access the application through a domain. Amazon CloudFront receives the request: Checks the cache to return static content (HTML/CSS/JS) from S3 if available. If content is not in cache, CloudFront fetches from S3 and returns it to the user with low latency. Users receive the frontend and interact with the UI, generating API requests. Authentication \u0026amp; API Handling\nWhen users log in: Amazon Cognito authenticates login information (username/password or OAuth). Cognito generates a JWT token and returns it to the client. The frontend sends API requests with the JWT token to API Gateway. API Gateway performs: Verifies the JWT token with Cognito. If the token is valid, the request is forwarded to the corresponding Lambda function. If the token is invalid, API Gateway returns a 401 Unauthorized error. Lambda Processing \u0026amp; Data Access\nAWS Lambda executes business logic: Manages students, attendance, course registration, updates results, schedules… When accessing sensitive information (API keys, DB passwords), Lambda calls AWS Secrets Manager. Lambda reads/writes data to Amazon DynamoDB: DynamoDB stores data in a NoSQL model, optimized for read/write, automatically scaling when traffic increases. Supports queries using primary key (PK) or secondary index (GSI). Lambda logs to CloudWatch Logs, including requests, errors, and execution metrics. Security \u0026amp; Access Control\nAmazon Cognito: authenticates users and manages sessions, supporting OAuth/Google Sign-In. IAM Roles \u0026amp; Policies: control access permissions between AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3). API Gateway Authorization: validates JWT tokens from Cognito before allowing Lambda access. Secrets Manager: protects sensitive information (API keys, database credentials), enabling secure Lambda access. Monitoring \u0026amp; Alerts\nCloudWatch Logs collects logs from Lambda and API Gateway. Metrics \u0026amp; Alarms: Creates metrics from logs (CPU, error rate, latency, request count). Configures CloudWatch Alarms to trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded. Amazon SNS sends real-time alerts to the operations team via email or HTTP/SMS endpoints. Combines CloudTrail + CloudWatch for auditing API actions and overall security. CI/CD \u0026amp; Deployment\nGitLab: stores source code and manages version control. GitLab Runner: Automatically triggers on code push or merge request. Runs CI/CD pipeline with stages: test, build, deploy. Installs dependencies and runs unit tests. Builds artifacts (ZIP package for Lambda). AWS SAM CLI / CloudFormation: GitLab Runner uses AWS SAM CLI for deployment. Deploys or updates the entire AWS infrastructure (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, IAM Role). Ensures infrastructure follows IaC model, consistent across Dev/Prod environments. Automated CI/CD reduces errors and shortens deployment time. Summary\nRequest Path: User → CloudFront → API Gateway → Lambda (via Cognito Auth) → DynamoDB → Lambda → API Gateway → CloudFront → User. Security Path: Cognito Authentication → API Gateway Authorization → IAM Policies → Secrets Manager. Monitoring: CloudWatch Logs \u0026amp; Metrics → Alarms → SNS. CI/CD Path: GitLab → GitLab Runner → AWS SAM CLI → CloudFormation → AWS Resources. AWS Services Used Services Description Frontend \u0026amp; CDN CloudFront, S3 Content distribution, static storage Backend \u0026amp; Logic API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Secrets Manager, Cognito Serverless logic, data, authentication Monitoring CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Alarms, CloudWatch Metrics, SNS Monitoring, alerts, metrics collection CI/CD \u0026amp; IaC CloudFormation, SAM Automated deployment and infrastructure management (with GitLab Runner) 4. Technical Implementation Deployment Stages\nDevelopment Stage Complete business logic and main flow for Lambda functions. Write template.yaml file describing resources: API Gateway, Lambda Functions, DynamoDB, Cognito. Use AWS SAM CLI to deploy code and template.yaml to LocalStack for local testing. Deployment Stage: Use AWS SAM CLI to deploy code and template.yaml to the real AWS environment. Configure GitLab CI/CD with GitLab Runner to automate the build and deployment process. Technical Requirements\nHave an AWS account using Free Tier to deploy and use resources normally. The template.yaml file must be correctly configured to fully describe all services. The system must have an automatic rollback mechanism in case of deployment failure. 5. Roadmap \u0026amp; Deployment Milestones Pre-Internship (Week 0): Learn AWS services to prepare for the project. Survey, analyze requirements and related departments of real centers (HR, Training, Admissions). Internship (Week 1-12): Week 1–3: System design, UI design, overall architecture, and prepare documentation (proposal, diagrams, SAM template). Week 4–8: Develop core modules (student management, instructor management, class management, user authentication). Local testing using LocalStack. Week 9–11: Integrate modules, finalize CI/CD pipeline, deploy the system to the real AWS environment. Week 12: End-to-end testing, evaluate results, complete report, and propose future development directions.

Free Tier Exceeding: Monitor costs regularly, set up Billing Alerts, optimize resources. Data Loss: Enable S3 Versioning, periodically backup DynamoDB data. Service Integration Errors: Ensure services operate in the same Region, verify IAM Roles and cross-service access permissions. Application Security: Validate input at Lambda layer, use Cognito for strict authentication, configure CORS properly on API Gateway, apply principle of least privilege for IAM roles, enable CloudWatch and API Gateway logging for auditing. Contingency Plan\nDeployment failures: Rollback using AWS SAM CLI or restore previous Lambda version through CloudFormation stack. Budget overrun: Pause non-essential services, optimize architecture and resource usage. Security incidents: Review CloudWatch logs, disable compromised users/tokens via Cognito, review IAM permissions, isolate affected Lambda functions. 8. Expected Outcomes The teaching center management system is successfully deployed on AWS Serverless, ensuring stable, secure, and scalable operations. Optimize operational costs by leveraging AWS Free Tier and serverless architecture, reducing initial infrastructure investment. Ensure high access performance, fast response time, and flexible scalability. Guarantee data safety with backup, versioning, and strict access control mechanisms. CI/CD integration automates deployment, testing, and rollback, ensuring efficient and reliable development processes. "
